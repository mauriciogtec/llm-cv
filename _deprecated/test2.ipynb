In this paper, we investigate whether one such objective, the\\nWasserstein-1 distance between a policy's state visitation distribution and a\\ntarget distribution, can be utilized effectively for reinforcement learning\\n(RL) tasks. Specifically, this paper focuses on goal-conditioned reinforcement\\nlearning where the idealized (unachievable) target distribution has full\\nmeasure at the goal. This paper introduces a quasimetric specific to Markov\\nDecision Processes (MDPs) and uses this quasimetric to estimate the above\\nWasserstein-1 distance. It further shows that the policy that minimizes this\\nWasserstein-1 distance is the policy that reaches the goal in as few steps as\\npossible. Our approach, termed Adversarial Intrinsic Motivation (AIM),\\nestimates this Wasserstein-1 distance through its dual objective and uses it to\\ncompute a supplemental reward function. Our experiments show that this reward\\nfunction changes smoothly with respect to transitions in the MDP and directs\\nthe agent's exploration to find the goal efficiently. Additionally, we combine\\nAIM with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and show that the resulting\\nalgorithm accelerates learning significantly on several simulated robotics\\ntasks when compared to other rewards that encourage exploration or accelerate\\nlearning.\"}),\n",
